# Federated-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Classification
## Project Overview





Problem: Centralized machine learning risks privacy breaches in healthcare. Federated learning trains models locally on client data, aggregating only model updates.



Objective: Demonstrate a privacy-preserving FL system for medical image classification, simulating hospitals with non-IID data.



Features:

Federated learning with Flower and PyTorch.



Differential privacy using Opacus.



Visualization of accuracy and loss over rounds.



Relevance: Aligns with research in distributed machine learning, differential privacy, and AI for healthcare.
